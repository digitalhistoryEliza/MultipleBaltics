												  <h2>Call for PhD Workshop Leaders!</h2>
												  <p>Share your expertise and contribute to the academic community!</p>
											  </header>
											  <p>
												  ISHA PhD & Training Committee is pleased to announce an open call for <strong>2 PhD workshop leaders</strong> (you can apply as solo or duo) for the ISHA Winter seminar “Multiple Baltics: Reimagining Social, Cultural and Spatial Dimensions of History”, taking place in Riga (December 3, 2025–December 7, 2025).
											  </p>
											  <p>
												  The PhD workshop concept is designed for both current doctoral students and MA students who are considering pursuing a PhD in the future. This PhD workshop, hosted by the ISHA PhD & Training Committee, focuses on transferable skills and key concepts and challenges of the PhD process. The PhD workshops were created to facilitate networking and the transfer of both practical and theoretical knowledge between actual and prospective PhD students. Moreover, the series of PhD workshops can be seen as a long-term project of creating and publishing a database of practical academic information. The PhD workshop aims to attract 10 participants and will be divided into three time slots, each lasting around 3 hours.
											  </p>
											  <h3>Your main tasks will be:</h3>
											  <ul>
												  <li>To organize the PhD workshop sessions, where all the discussed themes will be effectively synthesized, and a training session will be prepared to develop transferable skills.</li>
												  <li>To take care of the participants during the workshops (moderate the debate, make sure the workshops start and finish on time, take attendance etc.).</li>
											  </ul>
											  <h3>In the application, please provide us with:</h3>
											  <ol>
												  <li>a short introduction about your academic trajectory, detailing how far along in your research you already are (max 200 words),</li>
												  <li>a short abstract of your PhD workshop, stating the topic, what participants should prepare in advance and how you’re planning to open and guide the session. In your workshop proposal, theoretical and thematic inputs from your own research are welcome and appreciated.</li>
											  </ol>
											  <p>
												  Travel expenses, accommodations and meals will be covered.
											  </p>
											  <p>
												  If you think you’ve got what it takes, apply by <strong>October 7th</strong> to be a workshop leader at the ISHA 2025 Winter Seminar by sending your workshop proposal to <a href="mailto:phd-training@isha.international">phd-training[at]isha.international</a>.
											  </p>
											</div>
											<p>
												The Organising Committee will review the proposals and inform applicants in the middle of October.
