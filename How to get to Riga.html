                                       <h2>By Airplane</h2>
                                       <p>Riga has one airport (RIX), and flights to it are provided by several airlines from various cities in Europe and elsewhere in the world. It is not far from the city center, but you will need to use public transport or a taxi to get there.</p>
                                       <p>Bus No. 22 runs from the airport to the city center (where accommodation has been reserved for seminar participants). The bus runs every 10–20 minutes, with the first bus leaving at 5:25 a.m. and the last at 12:40 a.m. Tickets can be purchased at sales points at the airport (Narvesen stores or ticket machines) or via the app (Rīgas satiksme or Mobilly). We recommend downloading the app of your choice in advance, registering and entering the necessary payment information. Both apps also provide an online map that shows the real-time location of public transport. The ticket is valid for 90 minutes from the moment of registration on the vehicle, and during this time it can be re-registered on other routes. On bus No. 22, it is also possible to purchase a ticket from the driver using a payment card, but this ticket is slightly more expensive and can only be used on that journey.</p>
                                       <p>If you arrive when public transport is not running, you can use taxi services. Various companies provide these services at the airport, and the taxi is located right at the airport doors. However, you can also order your preferred taxi via an app (e.g., Bolt or Forus, but please note that Uber does not provide its services in Latvia). We recommend downloading the app in advance and filling in the necessary information. The price of a taxi ride depends on the service provider, transport availability, and demand.</p>
                                       <h2>By bus</h2>
                                       <p>For those who want to enjoy the view of Latvian countryside outside the capital, the bus may be the best way to get to Riga. Riga Bus Station is located in the city center, next to the famous Riga Central Market. Trips to Riga are provided by Flixbus (from Tallinn, Vilnius, Warsaw), Lux Express (from Tallinn, Tartu, Pärnu in Estonia; Klaipėda, Palanga, Vilnius in Lithuania; Warsaw in Poland), Ecolines (from Amsterdam, Rotterdam in the Netherlands; Berlin in Germany; Prague in the Czech Republic; Kiev and Lviv in Ukraine; Warsaw in Poland; Vilnius and Kaunas in Lithuania; Tallinn and Pärnu in Estonia) and other companies. More information about travel dates, departure and arrival times can be found on the service providers' websites.</p>
                                       <p>It is approximately a 10-minute walk from the bus station to the accommodation reserved for seminar participants.</p>
                                       <h2>By train</h2>
                                       <p>You can also reach Riga from Lithuania and Estonia by train. The route from Vilnius to Riga is operated by the Lithuanian carrier LTG Link, which runs once a day in each direction, stopping at other cities in Lithuania and Latvia. The journey takes approximately 4 hours. Find out more here.</p>
                                       <p>When travelling by train from Estonia, take the Tallinn–Riga route with a transfer in Valga. The train runs once a day in each direction from Tallinn via Tartu and other cities. In Valga, you will need to change trains, but passengers do not need to leave the platform to do so. Find out more here.</p>
                                       <p>The station is located in the city center, and it takes only about 5 minutes to walk to the accommodation.</p>
