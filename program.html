                                    <h3>7 Interactive Workshops in Parallel Sessions</h3>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Critical Cultural Heritage:</strong> Workshops will focus on the analysis of complex narratives, conflicts, and transformations within the Baltic urban environment, including the critical interpretation of monuments.<br /><strong>Workshop leaders:</strong> Kristina van Kuyck (Dublin City University, Ireland), Elina Ziehm (Leipzig University, Germany), Anika Olbrisch (Greiswald University, Germany).</li>

                                        <li><strong>Digital History:</strong> Workshops will discuss the suitability of digital methods for historical research, the diversity and challenges of historical data, and big data in historical science.

                                    </ul>

                                    <h3>Academic Contributions and Source Immersion</h3>

                                    <p>The academic content of the seminar will be supplemented by the internationally recognised perspective of the University of Latvia's lecturer <strong>Mārtiņš Mintaurs</strong> on 20th-century Baltic cultural history in his talk <em>"The Baltic World in History and Heritage Representations: Looking Back at the 20th Century."</em> <strong>Gustavs Strenga</strong>, Associate Professor at the Latvian Academy of Culture and one of the most internationally known researchers of the Baltic medieval period, will deliver a lecture on the reception of Baltic medieval history and historical memory, contextualized by the collective monograph <em>"Doing Memory: Medieval Saints and Heroes and Their Afterlives in the Baltic Sea Region (19th–20th centuries)" (De Gruyter, 2024)</em>, which he edited and contributed.</p>

                                    <p>Researchers <strong>Alise Akermane-Pokšāne</strong> and <strong>Jānis Ķimsis</strong> from the Latvian Biomedical Research and Study Centre will address the challenges of working in an interdisciplinary team and understanding the differences between various scientific languages in the workshop <em>"Boxes, barriers and embarrassment: the not so attractive side of interdisciplinary research."</em></p>

                                    <p>Seminar participants will also engage directly with historical sources by visiting the University of Latvia Library's collection of rare books and manuscripts, <strong>"Bibliotheca Rigensis,"</strong> which is arguably the oldest collection of its kind in the Baltic Sea region, to learn about its history and research potential.</p>
